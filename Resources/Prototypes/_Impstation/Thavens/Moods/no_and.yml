# Using radio communications is exceptionally rude. All conversations must be had in-person, face-to-face. Throw away your headset.
# INTERESTING: This is fantastic! I actually really like this one. It's kind of shunning a portion of ingame technology
#              that we all take for granted. It has a great excuse, going back to basics with real face to face conversation.
#              Encourages in-person interaction, meeting points, sending notes in mailing units.
# On a non-command character this is not more disrupting than a mute or deaf character
# PROBLEMATIC: This could be problematic on a command member, but damn it would be cool if a captain was like "I want to

# You have an entrepreneurial spirit. Profit is the most important thing in life, above all else.
